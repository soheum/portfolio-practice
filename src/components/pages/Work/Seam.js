In the beginning, we were asked to create a project brief that merges the topics of togetherness at the distance and future healthcare. We first conducted a general interview with people who are in the medical field, such as doctors, nurses or general practitioners to get an understanding of the healthcare scene.  From this interview, we realized how marginalized communities were being affected by COVID-19 pandemic. Marginalized communities meaning people who are not directly related to COVID-19, but are in need of care such as pregnant women, patients with neurodegenerative diseases or mental care.</span><br />

Along with basic symptoms and cure methods of Alzheimer’s, we also grasped a positive understanding of the disease. Trying to reinforce memory was not that important in terms of delaying the progression of Alzheimer’s, rather creating memorable memories with their loved ones was something more valuable.</span><br />
